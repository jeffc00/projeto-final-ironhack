# projeto-final-ironhack
An attempt at modelling news of Tesla stocks using NLP techniques and use a binary classification model to predict if daily close prices would be higher than the open price. Various libraries were used for this purpose such as sklearn, spaCy, NLTK, pandas and numpy.

For the future, I plan to include in the model other information on the stock, such as technical analysis metrics, fundamental analysis metrics, results from macroeconomic models and lagged prices. These should improve the model's performance substantially.
